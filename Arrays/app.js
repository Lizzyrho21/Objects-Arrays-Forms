//#### Exercise 1
//1. Create an array.
//2. Add four names to the array.
nameArray = ["John", "Jacob", "Jingleheimer", "Schmidt"];
//3. Print the array one entry at a time.
nameArray.forEach(name => {
    document.write(name)
});

//#### Exercise 2
//1. Create an array with 5 numbers in it.
let numArray = [1,2,3,4,5];
//2. Print the numbers one entry at a time.
numArray.forEach(number => {
    document.write(number)
});

//#### Exercise 3
//1. Create an array with 4 names.
let labArrayE3 = ["Ajay", "Octavio", "Anita", "Pathfinder"]
//2. Print the third item in the array.
document.write(labArrayE2[2]);
//3. Delete the second item.
splice(labArrayE2[1]);
//4. Print the third item in the array again.
document.write(labArrayE2[2]);

//### Exercise 4 
//Create the array [5,3,7, 4]. Pass the array to a new function to do the following:
//Print the array.
//Print the 3rd element of the numberList.
//Delete the second element.
//Print the 3rd index element.
let labArray4 = [5,3,7,4];
function Exercise4(numberArray){
